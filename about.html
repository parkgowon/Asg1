            <ul>
              <li>First games (Mario Kart, Super Mario) on first device (Nintendo DSI) pacified me for a few years</li>
              <li>Fell in love with FPS trying counter-strike source at a friend's house</li>
              <li>Received first PC at 11, along with 'it' games at the time (GTAV, Overwatch)</li>
              <li>Have been playing most big FPS's since then, eventually got interested in how they were made</li>
              <li>Took an online course for beginner level programming, involving minecraft and drag-drop boxes.</li>
              <li>Eventually led to me taking Immersive Media as my degree.</li>
