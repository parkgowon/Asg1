#This is my Personal Portfolio.
Based off my original website designed for my EAE admission, the site features the home, about, resume, project, contact, and link pages.
Picture on the homepage was taken by me, I believe I have a decent eye for photos.
About gives a brief insight into why i chose the path i am on as of right now.
My resume, created also by me, highlights my work experience and personal information.
Projects - My father is a musician, and often enough he asks me to take part in his projects, to which i happily oblige.
Contact form for easy communication.
And last, my socials, should the person choose to try an get to know me further.
